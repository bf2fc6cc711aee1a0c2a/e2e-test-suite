# E2E Test Suite

TestNG based Java test suite focused on e2e testing application services running in the cloud.

## Requirements

* java jdk 11
* maven >= 3.3.1
* kcat (only to run Kcat tests)

## Build and check checkstyle

```
mvn install -DskipTests
```

## Executing tests

### Running full test suite

```
mvn test
```

### Running single test

```
mvn verify -Dit.test=ClassName
```

### Running subset tests defined by maven profile

```
mvn verify -Psmoke
```

## Writing tests

* Test method must be annotated with annotation `@Test`.
* Every new test class must extend `TestBase`
* Environment variables are stored in static `Environment` class
* Every new and variable used in testsuite must be added to table or env variables
* The test class must be included in one of the TestNG suites in `suites/`

## Environment Variables

This environment variables are used to configure tests behaviour, the ENVs marked with the double asterisk (**) are
required to run all tests. But not all tests require all ENVs, if you want to run a single test you can check ahead the
required variables in the test sourcecode javadoc.

Environment variables can also be configured in the [config.json](#config-file) file.

## Config File

All [Environment variables](#environment-variables) can also be configured in a JSON file, by default they are loaded
from the `config.json` file located in the project root, but an alternative JSON file can be configured used the the
`CONFIG_FILE` env.

Config file example:

```json
{
  "PRIMARY_USERNAME": "my-primary-user",
  "PRIMARY_PASSWORD": "password",
  "SECONDARY_USERNAME": "my-secondary-user",
  "SECONDARY_PASSWORD": "password",
  "ALIEN_USERNAME": "my-alien-user",
  "ALIEN_PASSWORD": "password",
  "DEV_CLUSTER_SERVER": "https://api.my.cluster:6443",
  "DEV_CLUSTER_TOKEN": "token",
  "DEV_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE": "a-custom-namespace-if-local",
  "LAUNCH_KEY": "my-username-if-local"
}
```

You can create multiple local `*.config.json` file that will be ignored by git (ex: `prod.config.json`) and you can
easily switch between them in IntelliJ using the [EnvFile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) plugin and
setting the `CONFIG_FILE` env in the `.env` file in the project root.

## Test Environments

The default targeted environment is the application services stage env.

#### Stage

| Env                      | Value                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `OPENSHIFT_API_URI`      | `https://api.stage.openshift.com`          |
| `OPENSHIFT_IDENTITY_URI` | `https://identity.api.stage.openshift.com` |

#### Production

| Env                      | Value                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `OPENSHIFT_API_URI`      | `https://api.openshift.com`          |
| `OPENSHIFT_IDENTITY_URI` | `https://identity.api.openshift.com` |

## Profiles

| Name        | Description                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| default     | run kafka, registry, devexp and quickstarts test suites          |
| sandbox     | run the sandbox test suite to test the openshift sandbox cluster |
| quickstarts | run the cucumber quickstarts test suite                          |

## Report to Prometheus

Tests can report metrics to Prometheus to analyze or monitor behaviours, like the number and frequency of failed API
requests that are retried automatically. A push gateway is required to send the metrics to prometheus, and it is
configured with the following ENVs:

| Name                      | Description                 | Default value         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| `PROMETHEUS_PUSH_GATEWAY` | Prometheus Push Gateway URL | `https://example.com` |

## Short guides

### Create test users

The test users needs to be manually created before running the test suites, but not all users are required for all
tests.

#### Organization

1. Go to https://cloud.redhat.com/ and click on **Create an account**
2. You can choose _Personal_ or _Corporate_
3. Fill all the required and optional data fields and create the account

> This will automatically create a new Organization where the user is the organization owner.

#### Primary user

1. Go to https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/protected/usermgt/userList.html and login with the organization owner.
2. Click on **Add New User** and fill all the required and optional data fields for the primary user

> By default, the account will be able to create evaluation instances which will be enough to run single tests

#### Secondary user

2. Go to https://www.redhat.com/wapps/ugc/protected/usermgt/userList.html and login with the organization owner.
3. Click on **Add New User** and fill all the required and optional data fields for the secondary user

> The secondary user is exactly like the primary user, but by default it wouldn't have access to instances created by
> the primary user

#### Alien user

1. Go to https://cloud.redhat.com/ and click on **Create an account**
2. You can choose _Personal_ or _Corporate_
3. Fill all the required and optional data fields for the alien user and create the account

> This will create the Alien user in a new organization

### Create test namespace on the dev cluster

1. Login to the dev cluster as kubeadmin
    ```
    oc login --token=KUBE_ADMIN_TOKEN --server=DEV_CLUSTER_SERVER
    ```
2. Execute the `./hack/bootstrap-mk-e2e-tests-namespace.sh` script
    ```
   ./hack/bootstrap-mk-e2e-tests-namespace.sh
    ```
3. Update
   the [staging Vault](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/managed-services-ci/show/mk-e2e-test-suite/staging)
   with the new dev cluster token

### Recreate the service account for the sandbox cluster

1. Login to the sandbox cluster with the sandbox user
    ```
    oc login --token=KUBE_ADMIN_TOKEN --server=DEV_CLUSTER_SERVER
    ```
2. Execute the `./hack/bootstrap-mk-e2e-tests-namespace.sh` script
    ```
   SANDBOX=true NAMESPACE=THE_SANDBOX_NAMESPACE ./hack/bootstrap-mk-e2e-tests-namespace.sh
    ```
3. Update
   the [sandbox Vault](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/managed-services-ci/show/mk-e2e-test-suite/sandbox)
   with the new dev cluster token

### Update the rhoas-model dependency

1. Clone the operator the bf2/operator from here:https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/operator
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-operator.git
   cd app-services-operator
   ```

2. Checkout the right version you want to update to

   **Example:**
   ```
   git checkout 0.5.0
   ```

3. Build the all the JARs (See operator README.md for the required maven and java versions)
   ```
   mvn package
   ```

4. Copy the built **rhoas-model.VERSION.jar** to the e2e-test-suite **lib/** directory

   **Example:**
   ```
   cp source/model/target/rhoas-model-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar path/to/e2e-test-suite/lib
   ```

6. If the rhoas-model version has changed you need to update the pom.xml in the e2e-test-suite repository

5. Switch then to the e2e-test-suite repo and verify the build
   ```
   mvn verify -Psmoke
   ```

6. If the build pass, commit the changes and open a PR, otherwise fix the issues and then open a PR
